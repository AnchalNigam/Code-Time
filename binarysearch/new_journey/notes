why binary search is better than ternary search?
in ternary search, we divide array into three halves, 
ternary three equal halves division, 4 comparisons happen and as three parts so 4*log(base3)n
and in binary, 2 comparisons happens and division into two equal halves, so 2*log(base2)n.
more simplify it by dividing both time complexity then
binary  - log(base2)n
ternary - 2*log(base3)n

so convert 2*log(base3)n = 2*log2/log3 * log (base2)n >  log(base2)n. 
since 2*log2/log3 > 1, we actually get more comparisons with the ternary search.so binay is better.

**mainly binary search divide into half concept...either compare with target or mid+1 or mid-1 or both
