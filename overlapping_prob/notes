three types of problems i learnt, one is merge intervals - in this
if we need to find overlapping then sort array, sort array se start wala elem ascending 
me a ajayega. fr fr end > start of second elem that means overlap...then check
if start > dekhe matlb overalp nhi h toh merged value insert kr do result me
so ye thought h ki overlap k maintain kr rhe fr jahan na dekha whn merged krke result daal dia   



dusre kind of questn is ki if we want to see ki at a time kite overlap hue like meeting 2 and max
bandwidth me hme ye h find out krna tha ki kite intervals/meetings/channels overlap h rhe hai
ye wale ques me at a time kita overlap dekhna hai ar upar wale me merge krna hai.....
merge intervals me agr priority queue rkhnge toh at a time overlap nhi dekhega
take eg - [(1,6), (2,3), (4,5), (8,10), (10,15)]

is questn me priority queue min end time maintain hta h and array m starttime sorted hta hai
so now (2,3) in heap now ab 1,6 aya ab start time is < 2,3 then overlap hai..
now 4,5 aya wo 3 se jyda h start time(4>3) so pop kr do ab isko visualize kro (1,6),(2,3),(4,5)
me ap merging ni kr paoge because ap individual endtime chote wale event k next wale array 
ele se compare kr rhe agr wo non merging h toh pop kr de rhe bt 1,6 se wo 2,3 overlap kia hai
uska jawab maintain na kr paoge islie merge interval me use just soting of start time
no need of priority queue(maintainig end time).priority queue wala btata hai ki at a time
kite overlap interval h like 1,6 2,3 overlap h at a time fr 1,6 4,5 ai overlap at a time
but not 1,6 2,3 4,5 at a time nhi h as 2,3 4,5 alag alag h so at a time bs
do h elem overlap h...so at a time overlap me think of this...two concepts yaad rkho
one just sorting other sorting+ priority queue
