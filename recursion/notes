pros -
1. elegant 
2. complex for loop and less 
3. trees, json objects, graphs - best use case & recursion makes it easy


cons
1. cpu overhead
2. out of memory errors/stack overflow exception


1. think of base case - what smallest stuff you can encounter
2. what to do with return values -> approach to result

..........................................
1. To return something from recursion , use return
