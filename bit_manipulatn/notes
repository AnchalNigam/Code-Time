xor operator - even 1 is 0 and odd 1 is 1 - same bits means 0 and diff bit is 1
and operator - all 1 is 1 ...any 0is 0 meaning ek bhi 0 aya toh 0 hga
or - any 1 is 1, all 0 is 0 
negate - flip bits
right shift - ight side bit gayab h jaega ..right shift h jaynge - 101 . 5>>1 means 1 gayab h jaega right side
wala . that is (10)base2 which is nothing it is 2 in decimal....so right shift matb
jitna bar rigt shift hai like 1,2 utta bar apko divide krna h decimal me
binary me bits k riht side shift krna hai and decimal me smjhe toh number kutte bar 2 se divide krna hai

left shift me left me shift krna hai and decimal me smjhe toh multiply krna hai 2 se

swapping of number steps
1. a =  a^b 
2. b = a^b
3. a = a^b

xor of two same number is 0

to find partiular bit is set or not means us particular bit 1 hai ya 0..set mns it is 1 else 0 means 
not set.
to find..number k mask k sath & kro..mask aisa create kro k jis bit ka pucha h whn 1 ho
if 1 is there then uska & obvio 1 ayega if actual number k us bit p 1 hga vrna 0 ayega
so mask&n will give u 1 or 0 ..mask create krna easy h just 1 shift kr do jis bit ka pucha hai
mask = 1<<i 
mask&n = (1<<i)&n -  this will give u particular bit is set or not

set the ith bit = mask | n = mask is ((1<<n) | n)
unset the ith bit - mask & n = mask is ~(1<<i) & n

n-1 is last 1 n 0 hta hai n-1 me
so to unset 1st 1 do n & (n-1)
12 jo h wo kisi 2 ka power hai ni islie wo jite bhi power hte h uske neche 2 ki like 1,2,4,8 - ab inme se 4+8(2^2+2^3) will make 12.
so power of 2 me dekho 2^2+ 2^3 isme 2 and 3rd bit will be 1 rest will be 0 - 12 ka binary
represntn will be 1100
lets say 8 - as its a power of 2 which 2^3 so just make 3rd bit as 1 and rest 0 which is 1000
1000
11 - 1+2+8 - 1011

to find its power of 2 - n&n-1 == 0 it means ye power h 2 ka

to set all 1s to 0 -
while (n!=0):
  n = n&(n-1)
  cnt++
