recursion me by reference array, obj (every call of recursion apna picture bana ke rkhta hai
apne variables hte h bt agr reference wale type rkhoge like aray ob th wo updated pic 
rkhta) - if primitive th fr return krvao ar reference me th maintain rhega h

pass by reference hta h array, obj and all as we can change their value
arr = [1,2]
def check(arr):
  check[0] = 45
op arr = [45,2]
it will change arr value outside the env
whereas primitive one string, number change outside me nhi hga becase agr hm assignmet
kr dete h th fr naya ho jata hai memory me entry
def check(arr)
  arr = [9,0]

o/p arr =[1,2]

it will not alter outer arr[1,2] as you have reassigned it

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/986006/how-do-i-pass-a-variable-by-reference

if you want to maintain value during recursive calls, either pass that variable as argument
or recursive function define inside another function and give outer function
result variable and usethat result variable

1. recursion me har call apna variable maintain krta hai , if reference ka scene hta haith change
ho jata hai variable ka value. 
2. so return kroge th previous call k updated value mil jaega or updated value pane k lie 
array, obj ye sb use kro
3. recursion apne aap previous call pe aa jata hai jaise uska next call khatam hta hai, you
dont need to tell ki vapis kab ana wo apne aap aa jata h jaise h us function
ka execution kahatam hta h th jisne use callkia hota h woexecute shuru h jata

ways to solve problems:

Dict usage
sort the array and then do
Two pointers
sliding window
if paaas k element and all type ques h(next greater element eg) th stack queue
keep max sum no need to keep all sun in array and then print max sum
itertools(combination k way dhudhna hai kse solve hga)
sliding window
loop starts from left and right and acc to value dec by 1
Tuple can also be used to solve codes

Always dry run your code after writing
make sure to check case of when array or string of length 1 or 0 

when continuous types question hga toh sliding window
slidig window where window sizze is fixed and some question me window size nikalna hta hai
according to questions
Optimizaton can be done just by removing print and easy builtin methods usage


LENGTH OF LONGEST SUBSTRING WHOS NOT HAVING REPEATING CHARACTER
1. slinding window ka scene 
2. hm map banaynge ye dkhne k lie ki bhai repeating character kahan pe aya. jahan pe milta hai
fr us window k chota krne lagte tab tak jab tak koi bhi window me repeating char na mile
jaise nhi milta fr hm apna j badha dete mns window size badha dete
