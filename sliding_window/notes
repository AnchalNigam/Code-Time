slidig window pattern
1. it asks for contiguous subarray and all(arr, string/sunstr)
2. it will give k window size
3. lagest, max, mini dega 
4. sometimes window size nikalna hota hoga - variable size window
two types of window -
fixed window - when k is given
variable window - ask k what is k? window size can be 5 6 7 acc to quest like largest sum and all
man lo sum de rkha hai and then u have to find window size and might be ask hua h largest window size
jiska sum 5 ho or small window size. so is tarah se variable window k size pe questns hote hai


1. In fixed, we are maintaining k and then slide krte h and maintain krte h ans
2. in variable, we dont know k but we know condition, so frst meet the condition like sum
shoule be equal or greater. if meet then store the ans then as k inc sum krega if we move right
so we should decrease left pointer until k meet na kr le fr se condition
see below how left and right pointer are maintained
total = left = right = 0
res = len(nums) + 1
while right < len(nums):
    total += nums[right]
    while total >= target:
        res = min(res, right-left+1)
        total -= nums[left]
        left += 1
  right += 1
