To find duplicate numbers:

One way - with O(n) space and O(n) complexity

1. Use dictionary to store how many time that number is repeating
2. Then iterate iver that dict and check who is greater than 1 and add to your result string(res= "") with space.


Other way - with O(1) space and O(n) complexity

1. Sort the array
2. Check its adjaccent, if its same then add this to res string.

3rd way - with O(1) space and O(n) complexity
