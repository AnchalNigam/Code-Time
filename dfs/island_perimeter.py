# simple tha but still was not able to do because thought process n tha..
# isme simple scene ye h when u want to count perimeter , whe there is 0 and 
# 
# out of boundary so add 1 there and when there is 1 no entertainmentâ€¦recursion 
# goes and goes into deep till the return statement not found then uske pehle wala
#  cell pick krega mns (3,1) [visualize 1st wala eg of this prob]...start (0,1) 
# -> (1,1)->(2,1)->(3,1)->(4,1) , 4,1 return kr dega now again it comes back to (3,1) 
# then (3,2) thne again back..(2,1) as its traversed so again back -> (3,0) , (3,1) which 
# is traversed so again back to (3,0) now go to (2,0) again return as its 0 (water) now 
# again back to (3,0) now go to (3,-1) again back-> now ab (2,1) ka dekhnge and then usko 
# krke fr (1,1) so is tarah se backtrack hta
